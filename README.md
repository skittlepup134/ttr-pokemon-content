# The Pokémon Content Pack
## *A Pokémon-themed content pack for TTR. Ongoing project.*

### Introduction 
Hello everyone! I'm Princess Wacky Dandywhip (Wacky for short) and this is my first attempt at making a content pack for TTR. I was inspired after hearing some Legendary Pokémon battle music in the VP from another content pack, and this is the result! Please note that this is an ongoing long-term project that isn't my priority right now, so it'll likely be awhile until I have anything that's usable.

### Current priorities
- Finish Cog suits
- Finish identifying where everything is in the phase files

### Sneak peaks
